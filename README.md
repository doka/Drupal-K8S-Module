# Drupal-K8S-Module
Drupal 8 module to manage K8S deployments

Deploy Drupal on a Kubernetes cluster, download and enable this module.

This module can manage other Drupal based deployments on the same Kubernetes cluster, where it is running.

Module is in work in progress, it's broken and won't work out of the box.
